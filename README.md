[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/svenvc/stamp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/svenvc/stamp)

Stamp is an implementation of STOMP (Simple (or Streaming) Text Oriented Message Protocol) for Pharo, a protocol to interact with message-oriented middleware (MOM).

More specifically, Stamp implements STOMP 1.2 and was tested against RabbitMQ 3.1. Other message-oriented middleware implementations accessible through STOMP include Apache ActiveMQ, Glassfish Open MQ and Fuse Message Broker based on Active MQ - but these have not yet been tested.

Messaging middleware is an important technology for building scaleable and flexible enterprise software architectures.
